## Setting

The dusk market — lantern light, long shadows, soldiers loading ships against a burning horizon, and a mix of legitimate trade and opportunistic crime. Each of the party are at the docks of Nanessa for their own reasons

### Reasons to attend the Dusk Market

#### **Human Ranger — Ex-Mercenary**

1. **Security Work at Dusk**A merchant hired him to watch a shipment being loaded before nightfall — wartime panic has made cargo theft common. He’s scanning the crowd for trouble when the market fills.
2. **Following a Rumor** He heard whispers that someone from his old mercenary company — or someone who knows what happened to them — was seen near the docks dealing in contraband.
3. **Selling Salvaged Gear** He’s offloading spare equipment to afford travel or supplies, negotiating with a stall owner who specializes in secondhand weapons.

#### **Kobold Elementalist — Smuggler-Turned-Honor-Seeker**

1. **Meeting a Fence** He’s arranging a deal for a small, morally acceptable job — carefully avoiding harming locals, but still navigating the underworld.
2. **Watching the Competition** A rival smuggling group has been muscling into familiar territory. He’s scouting their operation to see whether they’re exploiting the needy.
3. **Running a Favor** A community contact asked him to discreetly deliver goods to a struggling family — technically illegal, but aligned with his personal code.

#### **Elven Swordsman — Guild Envoy**

1. **Inspecting Shipments** He’s verifying crates of newly mined ore bound for guild smithies, ensuring the cargo isn’t tampered with or diluted.
2. **Recruitment Talks** A dockside foreman wants guild representation for workers worried about wartime exploitation — he’s meeting them unofficially.
3. **Investigating Black Market Metal** The guild suspects someone is selling counterfeit or stolen alloy. He’s checking stalls for suspicious craftsmanship.

#### **Orc Barbarian — War Survivor Seeking Truth**

1. **Questioning Veterans** Soldiers about to ship out may know something about the war that destroyed his home. He’s listening for names, units, or rumors.
2. **Memorial Offerings** He’s buying small carved tokens or incense to honor his family — a quiet ritual before moving on.
3. **Looking for Work** He’s hoping dock crews need muscle. Wartime chaos means short-term labor is plentiful.

#### **Mousefolk Inventor — Family Provider**

1. **Maintaining Dock Machinery** A crane or loading device is malfunctioning, and he’s finishing repairs before the night shift begins.
2. **Selling a Gadget** He’s trying to convince a skeptical merchant to buy a clever mechanical helper — something that could earn steady income for his family.
3. **Parts Hunting** Wartime scrap and ship salvage make rare components available. He’s hunting bargains before someone else snatches them.

#### **Elven Mage/Lawyer — Amnesiac Legal Mind**

1. **Contract Arbitration** Two merchants are arguing over wartime tariffs. He’s mediating — or trying to — to rebuild professional credibility.
2. **Following a Memory Fragment** Something about the docks feels familiar. He’s drawn there by half-remembered associations with smuggling law or naval contracts.
3. **Seeking Distraction** He’s browsing exotic wares or magical curios to escape his thoughts — a risky indulgence that could trigger memories.

### Pre-Chaos PC Crossovers

Think of these as **soft collisions** — brief, human, and optional.

#### 1) The Jammed Crane Incident

*(Mousefolk ↔ Ranger ↔ Orc)*

A dock crane groans and locks mid-swing, leaving cargo dangling over a crowd.

* The **mousefolk** is scrambling to fix it.
* The **ranger** instinctively clears civilians.
* The **orc** physically stabilizes the load or braces the mechanism.

Quick exchange:

> “Hold it steady!” “It *is* steady!” “…It’s not steady!”

They succeed — small applause from nearby workers.

**Result:** Shared competence moment. No heroics yet — just teamwork vibes.

#### 2) The Suspicious Stall

*(Kobold ↔ Swordsman ↔ Lawyer)*

A vendor is selling questionable “guild-approved” metal tools.

* The **swordsman** spots poor craftsmanship.
* The **kobold** recognizes black market markings.
* The **lawyer** overhears a heated dispute about legitimacy.

Short tension:

> Vendor: “Perfectly legal!” Swordsman: “…That alloy would snap cutting bread.” Kobold: *quietly* “He’s lying.”

The stall owner backs down or tries to bluff.

**Result:** Establishes shared suspicion + political tone.

#### 3) The Veteran Story

*(Orc ↔ Ranger ↔ Lawyer)*

A soldier loudly recounts a battlefield story… with inaccuracies.

* The **orc** reacts emotionally.
* The **ranger** recognizes tactical nonsense.
* The **lawyer** notes propaganda framing.

This becomes:

> “That’s not how that happened.” “You calling me a liar?” “…I’m calling you *misinformed*.”

Nearby tension breaks into awkward laughter or grumbling.

**Result:** War theme foreshadowing + mutual recognition.

#### 4) The Pickpocket Chain

*(Kobold ↔ Mousefolk ↔ Anyone)*

A young thief tries to lift a purse:

* Kobold spots the move.
* Mousefolk accidentally blocks the escape route.
* Another PC ends up holding the stolen coin pouch.

Moment of confusion:

> “That’s not mine.” “It’s not mine either.” “…Whose is it??”

The thief bolts or sheepishly apologizes.

**Result:** Criminal underworld flavor + shared moment.

#### 5) The Contract Dispute Spillover

*(Lawyer ↔ Swordsman ↔ Ranger)*

The lawyer is mediating an argument when tempers flare.

A crate gets kicked over…

Weapons/tools spill near the ranger’s feet.

He calmly picks one up, inspects it:

> “…This is balanced terribly.”

The swordsman agrees.

The arguing merchants suddenly feel outnumbered by competence.

**Result:** Establishes authority and camaraderie.

### Lighthearted / Comedic Moments

These should feel like **human texture**, not slapstick. Think Pirates of the Caribbean charm — levity inside a tense world.

#### The Overzealous Recruiter

A soldier tries to enlist *everyone*:

> “You! Strong arms! Ever held a spear?” Orc: “…Yes.” Recruiter: “Perfect! You’re halfway trained!”

He gets dragged away mid-pitch.

#### The Dramatic Merchant

A vendor insists his wares are essential for war survival:

> “This spice blend improves morale by 27%!”

No one asked.

#### The Competitive Dockworkers

Two workers argue whose rope knot is superior.

They rope in a PC to judge.

The knots are identical.

They refuse to believe it.

#### The Mechanical Demonstration

Mousefolk shows a tiny,”revolutionary” gadget.

It works beautifully…

…then shoots a harmless puff of smoke like a theatrical finale.

Crowd applauds anyway.

#### The Street Performer

A bard sings a wildly exaggerated heroic ballad about Verena.

Nearby veterans exchange looks:

> “…That’s not how that went.”

## **The Plot**

### Core Situation

Nanessa’s harbor is in wartime overdrive. Troop ships are loading supplies, ready to leave for Jaine in two weeks. Merchants rush last-minute contracts while smugglers exploit shortages: the Dockside markets are booming.

A plaza near the docks has turned into a chaotic wartime bazaar — legal traders mixed with black market sellers, entertainers, recruiters, gamblers, and pickpockets.

### Inciting Event — The Explosion

A battered smuggling vessel slips into harbor under false registration. As it drifts towards the port, it becomes clear that its not slowing down. Then, a fire starts on the ship, climbing the masts and furled sails. As people starts to react, a few leaving the plaza and some dockguard beginning to shout orders, the party have the opportunity to notice a wet straggler clawing out of the ocean and stumbling to shore.

Moments later:💥 A violent magical explosion tears through the ship.

Consequences:

* Dockside cranes collapse
* Fire spreads
* A mooring line snaps into the crowd
* Panic ripples through soldiers and civilians
* Contraband cargo spills into the water
* A strange magical pulse rolls across the plaza

The scene becomes a **multi-problem crisis**, letting players choose priorities.

### Immediate Crises

You want 3–4 simultaneous pressures so the party naturally divides and converges:

#### 1) Civilian Rescue (Order / Heroism)

Some dockworkers are trapped under fallen cargo which toppled in the shockwave. There is also a child caught in a burning stall, and a soldier pinned holding up a collapsed loading crane to provide space for people to escape.

If the party helps with any of these situations, their success will earn them goodwill with soldiers/civilians.

#### 2) The Fleeing Smuggler (Chaos / Pursuit)

A wounded smuggler bolts from the blast site, wet from the ocean swim. Under one arm she carries a fabric wrapped package. She weaves through market crowds, overturning stalls, and uses smoke and confusion to try to flee into the city.

If the party tries to stop her, this becomes a cinematic chase: sliding under carts, taking rooftop shortcuts, and dodging panicking soldiers who equally question the characters running from the scene.

Depending on the outcome, the smuggler may collapse from her wounds, be killed by crossfire, surrender her package to another theif, or accidentally drop the incriminating evidence.

If the party end up in possession of the artifact, they will be arrested by the local guard.

#### 3) Soldier Command Pressure (Authority vs Survival)

Off-duty soldiers begin trying to restore order in the less chaotic areas. They don't want people to panic or flee, but also don't want anyone to get hurt. Tensions in the city from so many soldiers begin to bubble over.

* conscripting bystanders to help
* threatening arrests
* accusing smugglers in the crowd

A tense situation develops:

* wrongful accusations
* rough handling of civilians
* jurisdiction confusion

Players must choose:

👉 cooperate 👉 mediate 👉 defy 👉 exploit

This injects immediate political tone.

#### 4) The Artifact Incident (Mystery Hook)

From the wreckage or smuggler:

A strange object is revealed:

* pulsing seawall magic
* forbidden military device
* relic from the Justicar Isles
* ancient ruin-tech
* prototype war tool

It reacts unpredictably:

* attracts attention
* emits magical resonance
* destabilizes structures

Now multiple factions want it.
