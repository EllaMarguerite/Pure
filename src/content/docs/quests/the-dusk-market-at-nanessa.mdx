## Setting

The dusk market — lantern light, long shadows, soldiers loading ships against a burning horizon, and a mix of legitimate trade and opportunistic crime. Each of the party are at the docks of Nanessa for their own reasons

### Reasons to attend the Dusk Market

#### **Human Ranger — Ex-Mercenary**

1. **Security Work at Dusk**<br>A merchant hired him to watch a shipment being loaded before nightfall — wartime panic has made cargo theft common. He’s scanning the crowd for trouble when the market fills.
2. **Following a Rumor**<br>He heard whispers that someone from his old mercenary company — or someone who knows what happened to them — was seen near the docks dealing in contraband.
3. **Selling Salvaged Gear**<br>He’s offloading spare equipment to afford travel or supplies, negotiating with a stall owner who specializes in secondhand weapons.

#### **Kobold Elementalist — Smuggler-Turned-Honor-Seeker**

1. **Meeting a Fence**<br>He’s arranging a deal for a small, morally acceptable job — carefully avoiding harming locals, but still navigating the underworld.
2. **Watching the Competition**<br>A rival smuggling group has been muscling into familiar territory. He’s scouting their operation to see whether they’re exploiting the needy.
3. **Running a Favor**<br>A community contact asked him to discreetly deliver goods to a struggling family — technically illegal, but aligned with his personal code.

#### **Elven Swordsman — Guild Envoy**

1. **Inspecting Shipments**<br>He’s verifying crates of newly mined ore bound for guild smithies, ensuring the cargo isn’t tampered with or diluted.
2. **Recruitment Talks**<br>A dockside foreman wants guild representation for workers worried about wartime exploitation — he’s meeting them unofficially.
3. **Investigating Black Market Metal**<br>The guild suspects someone is selling counterfeit or stolen alloy. He’s checking stalls for suspicious craftsmanship.

#### **Orc Barbarian — War Survivor Seeking Truth**

1. **Questioning Veterans**<br>Soldiers about to ship out may know something about the war that destroyed his home. He’s listening for names, units, or rumors.
2. **Memorial Offerings**<br>He’s buying small carved tokens or incense to honor his family — a quiet ritual before moving on.
3. **Looking for Work**<br>He’s hoping dock crews need muscle. Wartime chaos means short-term labor is plentiful.

#### **Mousefolk Inventor — Family Provider**

1. **Maintaining Dock Machinery**<br>A crane or loading device is malfunctioning, and he’s finishing repairs before the night shift begins.
2. **Selling a Gadget**<br>He’s trying to convince a skeptical merchant to buy a clever mechanical helper — something that could earn steady income for his family.
3. **Parts Hunting**<br>Wartime scrap and ship salvage make rare components available. He’s hunting bargains before someone else snatches them.

#### **Elven Mage/Lawyer — Amnesiac Legal Mind**

1. **Contract Arbitration**<br>Two merchants are arguing over wartime tariffs. He’s mediating — or trying to — to rebuild professional credibility.
2. **Following a Memory Fragment**<br>Something about the docks feels familiar. He’s drawn there by half-remembered associations with smuggling law or naval contracts.
3. **Seeking Distraction**<br>He’s browsing exotic wares or magical curios to escape his thoughts — a risky indulgence that could trigger memories.

## **The Plot**

### Core Situation

Nanessa’s harbor is in wartime overdrive. Troop ships are loading supplies, ready to leave for Jaine in two weeks. Merchants rush last-minute contracts while smugglers exploit shortages: the Dockside markets are booming.

A plaza near the docks has turned into a chaotic wartime bazaar — legal traders mixed with black market sellers, entertainers, recruiters, gamblers, and pickpockets.

### Inciting Event — The Explosion

A battered smuggling vessel slips into harbor under false registration. As it drifts towards the port, it becomes clear that its not slowing down. Then, a fire starts on the ship, climbing the masts and furled sails. As people starts to react, a few leaving the plaza and some dockguard beginning to shout orders, the party have the opportunity to notice a wet straggler clawing out of the ocean and stumbling to shore.

Moments later:💥 A violent magical explosion tears through the ship.

Consequences:

* Dockside cranes collapse
* Fire spreads
* A mooring line snaps into the crowd
* Panic ripples through soldiers and civilians
* Contraband cargo spills into the water
* A strange magical pulse rolls across the plaza

The scene becomes a **multi-problem crisis**, letting players choose priorities.

### Immediate Crises

You want 3–4 simultaneous pressures so the party naturally divides and converges:

#### 1) Civilian Rescue (Order / Heroism)

Some dockworkers are trapped under fallen cargo which toppled in the shockwave. There is also a child caught in a burning stall, and a soldier pinned holding up a collapsed loading crane to provide space for people to escape.

If the party helps with any of these situations, their success will earn them goodwill with soldiers/civilians.

#### 2) The Fleeing Smuggler (Chaos / Pursuit)

A wounded smuggler bolts from the blast site, wet from the ocean swim. Under one arm she carries a fabric wrapped package. She weaves through market crowds, overturning stalls, and uses smoke and confusion to try to flee into the city.

If the party tries to stop her, this becomes a cinematic chase: sliding under carts, taking rooftop shortcuts, and dodging panicking soldiers who equally question the characters running from the scene.

Depending on the outcome, the smuggler may collapse from her wounds, be killed by crossfire, surrender her package to another theif, or accidentally drop the incriminating evidence.

If the party end up in possession of the artifact, they will be arrested by the local guard.

#### 3) Soldier Command Pressure (Authority vs Survival)

Off-duty soldiers begin trying to restore order in the less chaotic areas. They don't want people to panic or flee, but also don't want anyone to get hurt. Tensions in the city from so many soldiers begin to bubble over.

* conscripting bystanders to help
* threatening arrests
* accusing smugglers in the crowd

A tense situation develops:

* wrongful accusations
* rough handling of civilians
* jurisdiction confusion

Players must choose:

👉 cooperate<br>👉 mediate<br>👉 defy<br>👉 exploit

This injects immediate political tone.

#### 4) The Artifact Incident (Mystery Hook)

From the wreckage or smuggler:

A strange object is revealed:

* pulsing seawall magic
* forbidden military device
* relic from the Justicar Isles
* ancient ruin-tech
* prototype war tool

It reacts unpredictably:

* attracts attention
* emits magical resonance
* destabilizes structures

Now multiple factions want it.
