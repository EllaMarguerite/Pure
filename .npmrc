# Ensure npm uses the correct permissions for bin scripts
# If you encounter permission errors, ensure your build environment:
# 1. Uses Node.js 20+ (see .nvmrc)
# 2. Has write permissions to node_modules
# 3. Runs npm install with appropriate user permissions

# For CloudCannon specifically:
# - Go to Site Settings → Build configuration
# - Set Node version to "Use my .nvmrc file" or manually select 20.19.5+
# - See CLOUDCANNON_SETUP.md for detailed instructions

# Workaround for CloudCannon permission issues with bin scripts
# Skip bin linking for workspace packages to avoid chmod permission errors
ignore-scripts=false
# Note: We can't use ignore-scripts=true as it would skip all postinstall scripts
# Instead, we'll handle this in the build script
